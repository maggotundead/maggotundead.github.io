                        <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the application, website, products, and services, including without limitation to apply for, purchase, and make claims under your insurance policy, (“Services”) provided by Lemonade Inc. and its subsidiaries Lemonade, Ltd., an Israel corporation, Lemonade Insurance Company, a New York insurance corporation, and Lemonade Insurance Agency, LLC, a New York limited liability company (collectively with Lemonade, Inc., “Lemonade,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), so please read these Terms carefully, before using the Services.</p>

                        <p>References to “you” in these Terms of Service means you, your duly authorized representatives and any entity you may represent in connection with your use of the Services. Any reference made in these Terms of Service to “Lemonade” shall be deemed to have been made to Lemonade, Inc., its subsidiaries, successors, assignees, and affiliates, as well as any company that controls Lemonade, directly or indirectly, and any other subsidiary of that controlling company. Lemonade's family includes Lemonade Insurance Agency LLC, a New York resident insurance agent that will be licensed and appointed to represent Lemonade Insurance Company in each state in which Lemonade insurance is sold.</p>

                        <p>Not all of the products or services described on this website are available in all areas of the United States and you may not be eligible for them.

                        <p>We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify these Terms from time to time, which modification will be effective upon the posting of the modification to our App/website (collectively, "the App"), and will apply to causes of action arising after the effective date of the change. You should continue to check the App for changes. Your continued use of our App or otherwise the Services following the posting of changes to these Terms will mean that you accept those changes. By accessing or using our Services, you confirm that: - you can form a binding contract with us; and - you are over the age of 18, as the Services are not intended for children under 18. If it comes to our attention through reliable means that a registered user is a child under 18 years of age, we will cancel that user's account and/or access to the Services. If you are using the Services on behalf of a corporation (or any legal entity other than using it personally), you represent that you are authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity, and are nevertheless individually bound by these Terms even if we have a separate agreement with such corporation.</p>

                        <p>In order to use the App, you must have access to a wireless network, and you agree to pay all fees associated with such access. You also agree to pay all fees (if any) charged by Google Play or App Store in connection with the Services, including the App. You agree to comply with, and your license to use the App is conditioned upon your compliance with, all applicable third-party terms of use and agreements (e.g., Google Play’s or App Store's terms and policies) when using the Services, including the App. You acknowledge that Google Play and/or App Store (and its subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of the Terms and will have the right to enforce them.</p>

Do Not Rely on our Website or App for Your Financial Decisions. The Content on the Lemonade website, app and other content is for convenience and information purposes only. Nothing on therein should be construed as rendering tax, legal, investment, or accounting advice. The posting of any prospectus or any other information is not a recommendation or opinion for you to buy or sell any product or participate in any transaction.</p>
